    Eager loaders, such as joined loading, SELECT IN loading, etc., when
    configured on a mapper or via query options will now be invoked during
    the refresh on an expired object; in the case of selectinload and
    subqueryload, since the additional load is for a single object only,
    the "immediateload" scheme is used in these cases which resembles the
    single-parent query emitted by lazy loading.
