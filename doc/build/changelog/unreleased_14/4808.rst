    Added new "post compile parameters" feature.  This feature allows a
    :func:`.bindparam` construct to have its value rendered into the SQL string
    before being passed to the DBAPI driver, but after the compilation step,
    using the "literal render" feature of the compiler.  The immediate
    rationale for this feature is to support LIMIT/OFFSET schemes that don't
    work or perform well as bound parameters handled by the database driver,
    while still allowing for SQLAlchemy SQL constructs to be cacheable in their
    compiled form.     The immediate targets for the new feature are the "TOP
    N" clause used by SQL Server (and Sybase) which does not support a bound
    parameter, as well as the "ROWNUM" and optional "FIRST_ROWS()" schemes used
    by the Oracle dialect, the former of which has been known to perform better
    without bound parameters and the latter of which does not support a bound
    parameter.   The feature builds upon the mechanisms first developed to
    support "expanding" parameters for IN expressions.   As part of this
    feature, the Oracle ``use_binds_for_limits`` feature is turned on
    unconditionally and this flag is now deprecated.
