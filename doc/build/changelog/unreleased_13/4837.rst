    Characters that interfere with "pyformat" or "named" formats in bound
    parameters, namely ``%, (, )`` and the space character, as well as a few
    other typically undesirable characters, are stripped early for a
    :func:`.bindparam` that is using an anonymized name, which is typically
    generated automatically from a named column which itself includes these
    characters in its name and does not use a ``.key``, so that they do not
    interfere either with the SQLAlchemy compiler's use of string formatting or
    with the driver-level parsing of the parameter, both of which could be
    demonstrated before the fix.  The change only applies to anonymized
    parameter names that are generated and consumed internally, not end-user
    defined names, so the change should have no impact on any existing code.
    Applies in particular to the psycopg2 driver which does not otherwise quote
    special parameter names, but also strips leading underscores to suit Oracle
    (but not yet leading numbers, as some anon parameters are currently
    entirely numeric/underscore based); Oracle in any case continues to quote
    parameter names that include special characters.
