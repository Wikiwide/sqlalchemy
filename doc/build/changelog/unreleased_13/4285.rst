    Fixed unit test regression released in 1.3.8 that would cause failure for
    Oracle, SQL Server and other non-native ENUM platforms due to new
    enumeration tests added as part of :ticket:`4285` enum sortability in the
    unit of work; the enumerations created constraints that were duplicated on
    name.
